Can also be done on T16 but T17 is ways better.  
Roll maps for pack size and quant (but more focus on pack size as 2% = 1% chance to double mobs).

**Scarabs:** 1x Horned Scarab of Awakening, 3x Scarab of Risk, 1x Harvest Scarab of Doubling

Can also use a Scarab of Lineage for more packsize.

**Map Device:** Blue Altars with Imbued Harvest
