Farming 8 mod T16 and T17 maps. Averages at around 0.7 to 0.9 T17s per map.  
Can also be done on T17s but won't drop T17 maps then. Roll T17 maps for high% more maps.

**Scarabs:** 2x Cartography Scarab of the Multitude, 1x Cartography Scarab of Escalation, 1x Cartography Scarab of Risk, 1x Cartography Scarab of Corruption
